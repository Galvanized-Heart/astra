# âœ… Project To-Do List

### **Rana**
- [x] Write Overleaf paper outline
- [x] Put together NeurIPS submission template
- [ ] Design a few different model architectures (won't touch derivation)
- [ ] Run interpretability analysis on:
  - Linear model coefficients
  - Attention values (if applicable)

### **Max**
- [x] Make private copy of the repo that's okay to get messy (won't affect original)
- [x] Implement functions to rebuild **kcat**, **Km**, **Ki**
- [ ] Build training logic
- [ ] Test dataloader with 2 simple models:
  - XGBoost
  - Linear Regression

### **Anyone**
- [ ] Optimize hyperparameters for performance (Optuna?)
- [ ] Create splitting functions (e.g., random, stratified)
- [ ] Create featurizations for:
  - Proteins
  - Ligands (SMILES)
- [ ] Investigate (proof of concept) experimental data that could inform:
  - \(k_1\), \(k_{-1}\), \(k_2\), etc.

## ðŸ”Ž Model Comparisons to Perform
1. `model -> [kcat]` **&&** `model -> [Km]` **&&** `model -> [Ki]`
2. `model -> [kcat, Km, Ki]` (joint prediction)
3. `model -> [k1, k-1, k2] -> [kcat, Km, Ki]`
4. `model -> [k1, k-1, k2, k-2, k3] -> [kcat, Km, Ki]`
